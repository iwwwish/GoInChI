GoInChI
=======

GoInChI is an ultra light-weight HTTP GET client that facilitates various format conversions both "to and from" InChI and InChIKey. 

###### How to use:

    git clone https://github.com/vishalkpp/GoInChI.git
    cd GoInChI/
    ant
  
Execute the above commands to build the project locally and find the GoInChI.jar in the dist folder. Use the .jar file wherever required. It is also convenient to use the source files directly in your project.

###### Acknowledgment:

GoInChI, shamelessly relies on the ChemSpider's InChI [Webservice](https://www.chemspider.com/InChI.asmx).
